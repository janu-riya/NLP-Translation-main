# SIH---NLP-Translation

Problem Statement:

            Traditionally, lot of challenges are faced by vernacular-medium students as compared to English 
            medium students, in terms of learning, opportunities and overall personality development. Hence, 
            inline with the new National Education Policy 2020 promulgated by GoI, it is need of the hour to 
            bridge the above gaps faced by Indian students using disruptive technology solutions â€“ NLP, AI, 
            IOT, etc. These solutions cover audio/visual/textual/other modes of education content processing 
            and delivery to the students.
            
Solution:

            Here we are going to develop an web application for Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology 
            solutions for mass-effective conceptual learning and education in vernacular languages (in mother 
            tongues), which consists of some modules such as, 

                                Text to Text , 
                                Audio to Audio, 
                                Video to Video , 
                                Image to Text translation in vernacular languages.

Tech Stacks:

            We have developed an Web application using NLP, deep learning.
            
                     Frontend      -    HTML,CSS,Bootstrap                   
                     Framework     -    Flask
                     Language      -    Python
                     Modules       -    Speech_recognition, NLLB(No language left behind), PyDub, 
                                       speech_recognition, gTTS, moviepy, pytesseract.
